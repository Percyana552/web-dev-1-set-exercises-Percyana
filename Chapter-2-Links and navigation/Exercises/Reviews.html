        <p>1-The show follows the footsteps of Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer in a cybersecurity firm 'Allsafe' by day and vigilante hacker operating from his computer, apprehending no-gooders by night. Elliot struggles with social interactions because of his Chronic Depression and Social Anxiety but he persists with zeal to follow through with his plans. Throughout the show, we witness the world in a second person perspective- we listen to his thoughts talking directly to us while we try to understand the unfolding storyline together. This unique story-telling perspective allows us to detach from seeing the show through one person's view, rather as a hovering observer, watching the pieces fall together as well having an apparent connection to the world. 
         The show really starts to show it's charm when Elliot joins a hacker group on a mission to rid the new-age world of debt by performing a large scale hack to erase data of loans, mortgages etc, as a result, the world's largest redistribution of wealth takes place. In the process of carrying out the mission, many things about our protagonist and the world he lives in, we uncover the strings that allow the big enterprises to be as powerful as they are as well as the reality shattering exposition that Elliot has Dissociative Identity Disorder also referred to as Split Personality disorder or Multiple Personality Disorder. The show is something beyond just another sci-fi thriller, rather the show takes us on a cathartic experience in understanding the demons of the world we live in and how such a world creates  
         beings with polarizing traits yet the very same beings are an integral part of a bigger system, something that grew from flawed inception. The show recurringly shows the effects of high-efficiency capitalism and how powerful technology has become and how much it can detach us from all connections from our life.
         Tackling the many sensitive topics portrayed in the show with incredible foresight, allowed for a cohesive transition from one plot to another, all the while developing the character's personality - them overcoming their flaws as well as developing new ones. The constant and consistent mind-melting twists coupled with the sound design from the detail in ambience to intense scores during key moments of a plot, combined with the creative framing of subjects to convey how much the characters are invested (or the lack thereof) creates a captivating experience that  strikes both our conscious and subconscious experience of watching the show. 
         It is without a doubt, a one of a kind show that no other could take its place. Winning multiple awards, Mr. Robot is a testament that you can create deep, rich stories with dynamic character interactions from a very simple premise - What would it be like to live a life of thrill and how one can impact and change the world in unbelievable ways.
         I loved every bit of the show and already miss it!</p>
         <p>2-Best series i have watched, not only for drama, suspense and mind melting twists, the musical score and sound is digitally fantastic. If you were ever an old school raver or digital music fanatic, the sense of your spine tingling when certain build ups happen in the series is as satisfying. Maybe a bit too nostalgic in some areas for millennial's but it was perfect for me. The second season seems slow but it isn't, just need to keep going and you'll see. I thought Ram Malek was brilliant before this as i had seem him in 24(series), only for a few episodes, but the scene with him and Keifer Sutherland is mesmerising and heartbreaking, but some of the best acting i had scene in a tv series. Christian Slater has always been one of my favourite actors as well, and the female cast in this is superb, with strong amazing performances by all. I have watched the series since completion again and it is just truly genius in every way and has to be number 1 series for me last decade, hands down. Best way to watch, Lights out deprivation tank style, noise cancelling headphones turned way up and sat as close
         to the screen as possible.Hello Friend!

         <p>3-Very beautiful portrayal of dissociative identity disorder (some minor mistakes, like "creation" of alters, it sounds like Elliot had to choose how they looked, what they did, that's not how it works (the Christa INSIDE Eliott's mind phrased it that way, so it was based on Elliott's knowledge, but anyway), I would recommend researching this disorder and learning about it before watching the series, as it will help you understand what's going on), I liked that he wasn't portrayed as a monster, or having a superpower (if you watched the Split, you know what I'm talking about), because people with DID are horribly traumatized people, who are struggling their whole life to live normally.
         THE MUSIC... I usually ignore music and sound effects in movies, but here it goes so perfect with every scene that you SEE the sounds and HEAR the visuals, so incredibly done.THE VISUALS... Even if you ignore the storyline and music THE VISUALS are something else, I loved the camera work, transitions, color correction..
